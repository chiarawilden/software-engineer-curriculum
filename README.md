# Software Engineer Curriculum 📚

*Work in Progress*

A curated list of tools and resources for the aspiring Senior Fullstack Engineer 👩‍💻 

All recommended content is that which I have personally consumed in full. This list is **not** by any means meant to be exhaustive. It aims to provide a simple, straightforward path to learning all critical skills and concepts necessary to qualify for the role of Senior Engineer. 

These are some of the best online resources I've found for developing both a strong theoretical and technical foundation in computer science and programming.

In my experience, many of the *very* best resources are not entirely free. However, compared to the cost for a classical undergraduate education (relatively speaking), as a bundle, they are significantly more affordable. Commiting to purchasing some material(s), if possible, is also wildly motivating ✨
